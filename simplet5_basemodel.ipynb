Lucy Waterlow . PUBLISHED: . 10:00 EST, 22 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:20 EST, 25 November 2013 . Sexy lingerie may be at the top of many women's Christmas lists this year but you'll need an especially rich and generous partner to receive an item from a new capsule collection in Selfridges. The department store will exclusively stock lingerie by label Bordelle whose collection includes one girdle dress costing an eye-watering £4,000. The bondage-inspired black garment is made with satin elastic bands, customised French embroidered lace, 18-carat gold plated decorations and buckles and hand-sewn Swarovski crystals. Decadent: Bordelle's Roxelana girdle dress costs £4,000 and is embellished with Swarovski crystals, left, a model wears a similar style, right . British designer, Alex Popa, who founded Bordelle, told Vogue the lingerie is worth the high price tag because it's made-to-measure using expensive materials. She said: 'The brand has been going for five years now, and we really wanted to create something really decadent this Christmas. 'Each piece is handmade and numbered one, two or three of three. The pieces use gold filigree, Swarovski crystals, the most luxurious fabrics - and each piece takes seven to ten days to make. Completely made to order, it's our most couture collection yet.' Expensive taste: This Adana Body, left is £1,302 while the Angela dress, right, is £651 . Although still not affordable for many, other items in the collection come at a cheaper price than the extravagant girdle dress. A similar version of the £4,000 item without crystals is £1,025. Prices for other garments range from £54 for an 'everyday' thong while a simpler corset dress costs £420 and a bra and knicker set £126 and £72 respectively. All items are available in small, medium and large sizes with adjustable features for a closer fit. Miss Popa told MailOnline: 'There is something that can appeal to every woman, from the modern . romantic to the fashion forward dominatrix looking for design novelty, . impeccable quality and a little bit of fun and games.' This set costs £348.75 for the bodice bra and £186 for the suspender briefs: No wonder the label has a celebrity following . Bordelle launched in 2009 and have quickly become a favourite with celebrities and those with expensive taste. They've made designs for Lady Gaga, Shakira and Christina Aguilera in their London workshop. Their £900 feather girdle sold out in 24 hours at Selfridge's Oxford Street store in central London ahead of Christmas 2009. Miss Popa said she was inspired to set up her own label at a time when 'very few lingerie labels were truly experimental with their offerings and there was a genuine lack of designer lingerie that successfully combined directional lingerie design with high fashion and a touch of bondage.' She added: ''Women are powerful and extravagant and this is something I explored with the initial designs.'\n","\n","\n","Summary Text : \n","Department store will exclusively stock lingerie by Bordelle .\n","Label make made-to-measure pieces .\n","£4,000 price tag is on corset embellished with Swarovski crystals .\n","Cheapest item is thong for £54 .\n","===========================================================================================================\n","\n","\n","Original Text : \n","By . Emma Reynolds . UPDATED: . 10:53 EST, 17 September 2011 . He was once a clean-shaven Canadian jock with a crew cut and dazzling white smile. Now his ragged appearance makes Brad Pitt's foray into the forest of facial hair look positively restrained. Hirsute rugby player Adam Kleeberger is desperate to cut out the caveman act - only his fans won't let him. Because he's worth it: Adam Kleeberger looks as though he could be selling shampoo rather than playing rugby for his country . The furry flanker is now trending on Twitter because of those tangled locks - which topped off his man-of-the-match performance in Canada's win over Tonga at the rugby world cup on Wednesday. 'It would be pretty hard for me not to shave it off,' he told the tournament's website. 'I kind of miss having my face. 'But right now I'm just focusing on this Rugby World Cup and I'll think about that afterwards.' The shaggy beard and long hair have been his crowning glory in the eyes of an adoring public after the Canucks' excellent start to the World Cup. They have attracted headlines such as 'Fear the beard' and 'Kleeberger helps his country win by a hair'. One less generous observer added: 'Kleeberger is 27, but his beard looks a bit older'. In a tangle: Fans don't want Kleeberger to chop off his flowing locks . Kleeberger has sparked a fashion for the castaway look among his national team, with Hubert Buydens and Jebb Sinclair also hoping that flowing beards will prove a source of strength. The rugby players are not the first smooth-skinned stars to try out a more rugged style. Boyishly handsome celebrities including Justin Timberlake, Ashton Kutcher and Jared Leto have all gone wild for the low-maintenance look. But Kleeberger has taken his dragged-through-a-hedge-backwards image to new extremes. Head band: Canada team-mate Hubert Buydens (centre) joins Kleeberger in letting his hair down ahead of the Rugby World Cup . The straggly, ginger chin fluff and brilliant play has wowed fans, who describe him as a 'beast'. The fashion-forward flanker - who plays for Canada's British Columbia Bears - is just hoping the publicity will bring in a crop of offers from top teams as a result of the publicity. 'If it does then that's great,' he said. 'I didn't really have a reason for growing the beard when I started and it's now got more attention than I ever thought possible. Chin stroke: The flanker is itching to get rid of his long hair and beard . 'So if that comes (a contract), hopefully it's based on the way I'm playing as well. But it would be nice.' Either way, rugby fans will be shorn of their unlikely style icon when Kleeberger  eventually takes the scissors to his seven months of dedicated hair-growth. But he won't be getting the chop from the Canada team any time soon. The country takes on France this Sunday at the New Zealand tournament, and they are still hoping to win by a whisker.\n","\n","\n","Summary Text : \n","27-year-old's whiskers a highlight of Rugby World Cup .\n","===========================================================================================================\n","\n","\n","Original Text : \n","(CNN) -- Despite being recently branded a \"rotten apple\" by AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi, Mario Balotelli was treated to a rapturous reception on his return to the northern Italian city. With votes at stake in the Italian elections -- La Stamp estimates the signing of \"Super Mario\" could be worth 400,000 votes as Berlusconi attempts a political comeback -- his new boss' blunt assessment was quickly forgotten as the former Italian prime minister sanctioned a $30 million deal to sign Balotelli. His transfer ends the striker's whirlwind two-and-half-year stay with English champions Manchester City, during which time a litany of dust-ups have allowed Balotelli to become a caricature of the modern playboy footballer -- sporting talent and tabloid cult hero rolled into one. One of his final acts as a City player was a training ground brawl with team manager Roberto Mancini, pictures of which were sprawled across newspapers. In the aftermath of the dust-up, Balotelli's teammate Carlos Tevez offered to counsel the 22-year-old striker. When Tevez, infamous for refusing to come off the substitutes bench during a match last season and subsequently going AWOL for three months, is doling out advise, it might be to seriously consider where your career is headed. Having signed a four-and-a-half-year deal, Balotelli's future now lies back in Milan, where he rose to prominence with AC's city rivals Inter between 2006 and 2010. Myriad stories -- both mythical and true -- surround Balotelli, who recently unveiled a head of bleach-blonde hair ahead of a match between second-place City and Arsenal. There's the one about Balotelli driving into a women's prison, or the time he reportedly threw darts at youth team players out of a training ground window -- not to mention the impromptu bonfire which burned down his bathroom hours before he became the face of a firework safety campaign. Or Balotelli being stopped by police for having thousands of pounds in a bag on the passenger seat of his car. His alleged response when inquisitive officers asked why he was carrying such a huge amount of cash was to say: \"Because I'm rich.\" Outrageous talent . City showed admirable patience with their mercurial marksman, hoping he could consistently produce the form which saw him spearhead Italy's run to the final of Euro 2012. Balotelli endured a tempestuous relationship with former Inter coach and current Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho, but in Mancini, also a one-time coach of the Italian international at the Nerazzurri, he found a staunch ally, though the City manager used the striker with increasing sparsity. It's this mix of lashings of outrageous talent, outlandish behavior and childish ill-discipline -- Balotelli has already picked up six red cards in his fledgling career -- which have made him a gold mine for newspapers. Vincent Pericard is one former player who has experienced the high of being at a leading club and the low of languishing in the game's lesser leagues. Born in Cameroon, Pericard was raised in France -- representing his adoptive country at under-21 level -- before he was snapped up by Italian giants Juventus as a teenager. A bright future was predicted for the striker, but after leaving Juve in 2002 he moved to England and spent a decade slowly falling through the leagues. He made five appearances for sixth-tier club Havant & Waterlooville before retiring from football in 2012, aged just 29. Since quitting the game, Pericard has set up Elite Welfare Management, a business aimed at helping foreign players settle within the English game. \"The organization is the sum of my own experiences,\" the former Stoke City and Portsmouth player told CNN. \"We want to stop players wasting their talent. We should support and understand what makes him behave the way he does, instead of judging him and saying he is a lunatic or he is not bothered,\" added Pericard, referring to Balotelli, who is of Ghanaian heritage and was born in Perugia and raised by an adoptive family in Brescia in northern Italy. \"All the problems relate to the social side of being a human being and how you interact with other people and how you interact with a new culture and how you adapt to it.\" Football clubs are experts when it comes to keeping a player in peak physical condition, but Pericard is convinced the game has room for improvement when it comes to addressing issues of mental well-being. \"A player spends 80% of his time outside of the club's supervision and only 20% inside of the club,\" continued the Frenchman. \"It is one thing to look at how a player is physically, but the mental well being of a player is just as important. It can be the difference between teams going up, getting relegated or reaching the Champions League. \"The mind plays a massive part in a player's development and performance and this is something clubs need to tap into if they want to increase their chances of winning.\" The view that talent alone is not enough is one which is widely supported by sports psychologists. That is an approach not lost on five-time European champions Liverpool. As part of a new philosophy adapted by manager Brendan Rodgers, -- appointed at Anfield in June last year -- the club recruited Dr Steve Peters, who helped hone the minds of Britain's all-conquering Olympic cyclists. \"It is absolutely vital that young players are given support right from the start,\" said Rebecca Symes, Sport Psychologist from British organization Sporting Success, who argues the amount of psychological support available to footballers decreases as they progress into the first team. The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), a body which represents the interests of soccer players in England and Wales, was not available for comment when contacted by CNN. \"The transition from an academy into a senior squad is a really significant time,\" continued Symes. \"I don't think enough emphasis is put on providing support to players during this transition and then throughout their professional career. \"While the access to support is a lot better compared to 10 years ago there is a lot of work still to do, especially in football.\" With clubs in England's top division receiving unprecedented levels of income -- the recent sale of EPL television rights domestically and internationally is set to generate more than $8 billion according to British media reports -- Symes sees no reason why mental health professionals should not be given a higher profile at clubs. \"Don't get me wrong there is some great work being done by organisations such as the PFA; Sporting Chance Clinic and the like. But appropriately qualified internal backroom staff fully integrated within a club is essential.\" Breaking into a top-flight team can transform a young player's life as they are exposed to the pressures of a voracious 24/7 media and experience a level of financial wealth which they previously would have probably only dreamed of. While sudden monetary gain itself might not destabilize a player, an inability to manage their finances in the long term might, suggests Dan Abrahams -- a sports psychologist specializing in football. \"I think its more having a capacity to deal with the wealth which comes to them,\" said Abrahams. \"Over time, if you're not doing that, it can create pressure. \"The club needs to produce a culture of excellence,\" added Abrahams. \"The five Cs -- culture; confidence, commitment, cohesion and caring. \"Many people would baulk at the last one. They might become multimillionaire footballers, but the only way they get there is if they have emotional and intellectual support.\" After a career which shares some parallels with that of Balotelli, what advice would Pericard -- with the benefit of hindsight -- offer to the Italian? \"To seek help and accept help that will allow him to fulfil your potential and play until 35 and maybe be the best player in the world,\" he answered. \"With everything surrounding him, that is not going to happen. Accept the help that people are giving. Please accept it\".

The 30-year program has been kept on life support because the United States has not readied another vehicle to take its place. \\\"What is not acceptable is the fact that the most powerful nation in the world, the United States of America, finds itself in a situation that we didn't do the proper planning to have a vehicle in place to replace shuttle when it lands its last landing,\\\" Bolden said. NASA originally planned to retire the aging shuttle fleet last September, but mission delays have pushed that date. But once Endeavour, Atlantis and Discovery are permanently grounded, Russia's aging Soyuz capsules will ferry astronauts and cosmonauts to the space station and bring what supplies can fit in the smaller craft. And that will have to do, perhaps throughout this decade, until commercial cargo spacecraft are available. The last shuttle landing, according to the administrator, will not be in April when Endeavour is scheduled to fly. NASA says it wants one more mission to resupply the space station. That flight would be STS-135 this summer, using the Atlantis orbiter and designated with the acronym that stands for \\\"Space Transportation System.\\\" But whether NASA will have the money for the flight -- about a half a billion dollars -- is in question. \\\"We are budgeted for 135 and unless something disastrous happens, it's our intent to fly it,\\\" said Bolden, \\\"It's in the authorization bill signed by the president back in November, so for me it's the law and I'm excited about it because I need it, so we plan to fly 135.\\\" That would leave three flights before the program ends. STS-133 using Discovery sits on the launch pad ready to make its last trip into space Thursday. In April, STS-134 with Endeavour is schedule to fly. Commanding that mission is astronaut Mark Kelly. Kelly's wife, U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, was among 19 people shot in Arizona during a political event. Giffords is going through rehabilitation in Houston as she recovers from a gunshot wound to the head. During a news conference, Kelly said his wife would attend his launch. \\\"I pray that he is absolutely correct,\\\" Bolden said, \\\"because for all in the NASA family, who have been praying with him ever since that Saturday, and all of us who love her and him, It would be just tremendous, it would be tremendous for the nation. It would give everybody a big boost.\\\" But with those launches, the nation is seeing an end to its only means of putting humans in space. It is also seeing an end to a program that caught the public's attention nearly 30 years ago, with the launch on April 12, 1981, of the shuttle Columbia on the program's first mission. Bolden hopes that at least two commercial space companies will emerge to transport astronauts to the International Space Station. This will allow NASA to concentrate on building a new heavy-lift rocket capable of leaving lower Earth orbit. There had been concern whether the space agency would have enough money to develop this vehicle. Bolden said the money is there to build a vehicle that will evolve over time. \\\"When I say we are not going to do things the way we used to, we're not building the world's heaviest, biggest rocket right out of the chute. It's going to take us ... a decade or so to get to the point that we have the final vehicle that is going to take the first humans to Mars,\\\" said Bolden. The White House has said it wants humans on Mars by the mid-2030s. Right now, Bolden says his priority is flying these last three shuttle missions and bringing the astronauts home safely.\",\n          \"summarize: (CNN) -- Erroll Southers In the aftermath of the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253, it is likely the Senate will move to confirm the embattled nomination of Southers as head of the Transportation Security Administration when it returns from its winter recess. Objections to Southers' confirmation were first made by Republican Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina over the potential unionization of TSA employees. Southers is the Los Angeles International Airport's assistant chief for homeland security and intelligence. The airport's police department, which Southers has helped manage since early 2007, is the largest such operation in the country, with approximately 1,200 employees. Southers is also associate director at the Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events at the University of Southern California. The former FBI special agent served as a deputy director of homeland security for California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. CNN Political Ticker: DeMint defends blocking appointment . Miriam Siefer The attorney who will defend the 23-year-old Nigerian man accused of trying to blow up Northwest Flight 253 is no stranger to terrorism cases, according to The Detroit News. Miriam Siefer, chief federal defender with the Federal Defender Office in Detroit, Michigan, represented James Nichols when he was a suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing. His brother Terry Nichols was convicted for that act of domestic terrorism. Siefer is now the lead attorney for Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, who is accused of hiding explosive materials sewn into his underwear that could have brought down the airplane. \\\"She's one of a handful of people who is universally respected and admired by people in the U.S. Attorney's Office,\\\" said Alan Gershel, the former head of criminal prosecutions in Detroit who now is a law professor at Cooley Law School in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Detroit News: Suspect's lawyer old hand at terror cases . Micah Fialka-Feldman A U.S. district judge has ruled that Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, violated a federal law by refusing to allow Fialka-Feldman, a disabled student, to live in a campus dorm and now must make a room available for him. The Detroit News and NPR report that Fialka-Feldman has a mild cognitive impairment that hinders his ability to read and write. But the university said because he was in a special program and not a full-time student, he couldn't live on campus. It took him two buses and two hours to get to campus from his parents' home. The judge ruled that Oakland University had discriminated against Fialka-Feldman, who says he will hang a poster in his room with quotes from civil rights leaders. One says: \\\"A community that excludes one member is not a community at all.\\\" NPR: Intellectually disabled student wins dorm suit . Detroit News: Student wins housing fight . William Koch The Palm Beach, Florida, billionaire says that a 1787 Lafite Bordeaux with Thomas Jefferson's initials etched into the bottle is fake. \\\"I thought that I had a piece of history, a piece of America's most important history,\\\" Koch told the Los Angeles Times. So Koch sued the seller and has filed four other lawsuits. He says there are more to come. His goal is to clean up an industry where a single bottle can go for more than $100,000. In 1989, Koch purchased the Lafite and three other bottles of Bordeaux, also purported to be Jefferson's, for about $500,000. In the federal lawsuit he filed in New York against the wine supplier, Koch claims Jefferson's \\\"initials\\\" were etched into the bottle with modern-day power tools.

What makes a person intriguing? There are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different. Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news. Some of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story. But every day, there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character, how they reached their decision, how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in. They arouse our curiosity. We hear about them and want to know more. What they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country. At times, there is even a mystery about them. What they have done may be unique, heroic, cowardly or ghastly, but they capture our imaginations. We want to know what makes them tick, why they believe what they do, and why they did what they did. They intrigue us.\",\n          \"summarize: Jose Mourinho, Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho are the star names confirmed for Deco's testimonial in July. The match in honour of the former Portuguese international will feature two of his teams, Porto's Class of '04 and Barcelona's Class of '06. Mourinho, currently in charge of Chelsea, will manage his Champions League-winning hosts at the Dragao Stadium. VIDEO Scroll to the bottom to watch some of Jose's funniest moment from the season . Remember me? Jose Mourinho will take charge of Porto for Deco's testimonial in July . Superstars: Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho will reunite for Barcelona's Class of '06, coached by Frank Rijkaard . Calls time: Deco called time on his glittering career earlier this year . After kick-starting a generation at the Catalan club, Dutch coach Frank Rijkaard will take charge of fellow European winners in 2006 Barca in the one-off game. Lionel Messi, Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto'o and Henrik Larsson will be on show according to Portuguese publication O Jogo, while Xavi and Andres Iniesta's participation depends on their fitness after the World Cup. Messi made his debut in a Barcelona shirt at the Dragao Stadium, and the match will give him a chance to link up with his idol once again. A teenage Argentine eventually oversaw Ronaldinho's departure to AC Milan with his sparkling displays, but owes a lot to the former No 10. 'Ronaldinho made everything much easier for me,' Messi told Barcelona's club website last year. 'He was also responsible for the change in Bar\\u00e7a. It was a bad time and the change that came about with his arrival was amazing. 'In the first year, he didn\\u2019t win anything but people fell in love with him. Then the trophies started coming and he made all those people happy. Bar\\u00e7a should always be grateful for everything he did.' European success: Barcelona won the Champions League in 2006, while Porto won in 2004 . Idol: Ronaldinho helped Messi settle upon his arrival in Spain as a teenager . Deco retired earlier this year after a glittering career. The Brazilian-born playmaker made his name at Porto, starring in that European success in 2004, then moving on to Barcelona. A switch to Chelsea saw him experience the Premier League, and he finished his career back at Fluminense in Brazil.

When artist Alan Dodd was asked by friends to paint a mural on a blank 50-foot-long wall at their home he transformed it into an optical illusion. Friendly faces behind windows and lifelike archways leading to landscapes are painted onto the cottage, in Eye, Suffolk. And the images give an illusion of a make-believe world within. Nationally-renowned artist Alan Dodd stands with the unusual mural that he painted on the side of a friend's home in Eye, Suffolk . The largest painting in the Eye mural is a blacksmith's forge, which takes in the skyline features of the town's church and castle. Quirky characters and also animals feature on other parts of the house side. More... The picture you never thought you'd see... Anna Wintour eating a burger and fries!

Sex slaves, public executions - yet glorious art like this: A majestic Roman eagle, newly unearthed in London, and a gripping account of life in AD100 . These include rabbits and chickens, and a captivating cat which stares from a painted window. Many of the images were inspired by the history of botany and horticulture. In one window Swedish botanist Carl Linneaus, who was the first person to categorise plants, sits writing with a quill pen. A parrot watches him from an ornate perch and an old fashioned wig sits beside him. Mr Dodd, who was taught by pop art pioneer David Hockney, paints the work, which he says is a homage to the market town's heritage . Mr Dodd adds the finishing touches to the masterpiece, which he says will benefit from being on a wall that stays out of the sun . The finished mural is incredibly detailed and Mr Dodd spent 55 hours up a ladder during the painting process . In another view influential British horticulturalist Gertrude Jekyll reclines in her rocking chair, looking into the secluded garden through the painted curtains. Mr Dodd's mural also features a red Royal Mail letterbox, adding even more colour to the finished work. The artist spent 55 days up a ladder to create images at the property in Eye, Suffolk. He says the stunning finished product is a homage to the heritage of the market town. In another detail from the mural an elderly lady reclines in a rocking chair next to a vase of flowers, while in a second window an intricate vase is displayed . Mr Dodd, 71, who lives in Weston, Suffolk, said: 'It was just a blank, long wall. 'You would not believe what a difference it has made to the space. 'The wall is about 650 square feet so it would not have been feasible to paint the whole thing so we decided to paint parts of it.' He added: 'The mural will also really benefit from being on a wall which is often away from direct sunlight.' Mr Dodd trained at the Royal Academy of Arts in the 1960s and was taught by influential pop art pioneer David Hockney. He now designs and paints murals for a living. The artist has used his skills to work on a number of important projects, including the Pompeiian ceiling decoration in the New Picture Room at Sir John Soane's Museum in London.\n","\n","\n","Summary Text : \n","Alan Dodd painted the stunning and unusual murals on the side of a friend's home in Eye, Suffolk .\n","He took 55 hours to complete the work on the 50-foot-long house side and says it is a tribute to the town .\n","He paints historical scenes and was taught by influential artist David Hockney .\n","\n","\n","Fine tuned Predicted Summary Text : \n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (859 > 512).

The mother of a teenager who was killed when a friend crashed his car just four days after passing his test has spoken of her shock after the driver was jailed for only 12 months. Joshua Sadler, 21, lost control of his silver Renault Clio on a 60mph country road and smashed into a tree, killing front seat passenger Mikey Maguire, 19. Sadler had previously been convicted of a . string of serious motoring offences and twice banned from the road . before he even had a licence. He was seen on the night of the fatal crash performing handbrake turns and showing off in a car park. Sadler . pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving and was sentenced . to 12 months in jail and banned him from driving for five years. Afterwards Mr Maguire’s mother Allison Jarman, 43, described the sentence as an ‘insult’. She said: 'When I was in court my head was in my hands and at one point I couldn’t even listen to what was happening. 'I . expected the sentence to be low because I have been doing a lot of . research online but when I heard it was 12 months it felt like a slap in . the face. 'Nothing can . bring Mikey back but 12 months for my son’s life is shocking. I was . absolutely speechless, he will be out in three months. 'Mikey and Joshua had known each other for years but I was under the impression that they weren’t close any more. 'He . had always been a bit of a troublemaker and had previous convictions . for driving offences. I always said he would end up hurting someone one . day, I just didn’t expect it to be my son.' The fatal crash happened on Huntick Road, Lytchett Matravers, near Poole, Dorset, on February 8 last year. Sadler, from Poole, lost control of his . car on a bend before it ploughed down a grass bank and struck the tree. Mr Maguire was pronounced dead at the scene. Victim: Mikey Maguire pictured on on holiday with his mother Allison, who described the sentence as an 'insult' to her son's memory . Sadler had previously been disqualified from driving after being convicted of two counts of aggravated vehicle taking. He appeared in court for one of the counts and driving without a licence and insurance in July 2010. In both incidents he lost control and caused more than £5,000 damage to one of the vehicles. Les Smith, defending, read out a statement from Sadler to Bournemouth Crown Court in which he expressed ‘regret and sorrow’ for the Mr Maguire’s death. He added: 'The incident haunts me every day and will do for the rest of my life. Nothing that is said or done to me can make me feel any worse.' As well as being jailed Sadler was disqualified from driving for five years and ordered to take an extended test at the end of the ban.\n","\n","\n","Summary Text : \n","Joshua Sadler, 21, lost control on 60mph country road and hit a tree .\n","Front seat passenger Mikey Maguire, 19, was killed in the crash .\n","Sadler had previous convictions for a .\n","string of serious motoring offences .\n","He was twice banned from the road .\n","before he even had a licence .\n","Seen on night of the fatal crash performing handbrake turns in a car park .\n","Victim's mother described 12 month sentence as an 'insult' to her son's life .\n","\n","\n","Fine tuned Predicted Summary Text : \n","[\"Joshua Sadler, 21, lost control on 60mph country road and smashed into tree.

Mark Prigg . PUBLISHED: . 12:51 EST, 20 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 13:58 EST, 20 February 2014 . We swear far more on Twitter than in the real world, researchers have found. A major analysis of 51 million English language tweets revealed that one in 13 contains a curse. Researchers were also able to rank the most popular words, finding f**k was the most popular - and the top seven accounted for over 90% of offensive tweets. The most popular curse words on Twitter: Researchers examined a random one-month sample of 51 million English-language tweets from 14 million distinct user accounts . People curse more and more as the day passes, reaching a peak at 12 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. just before they go to bed, the researchers found. They also found people swore earlier in the week - Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays contained the most curse words relative to tweet volume. 'It’s a sizable fraction of the words we use,' Wenbo Wang, a PhD researcher at Wright State University who led the study, told Fastco. 'On average, one tweet out of 13 tweets will contain at least one cursing word,' 'Because of social media, people don’t see each other. 'They can say things they wouldn’t say in the physical world.' The team at Wright State University examined a random one-month sample of 51 million English-language tweets from 14 million distinct user accounts. They found that we curse more on Twitter than in real life, but tend to use only a few words. 'We found that the curse words occurred at the rate of 1.15% on Twitter, and 7.73% of all the tweets in our dataset contained curse words,' the team wrote in their paper, which was presented this week at the ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing. 'We also found that seven most frequently used curse words accounted for more than 90% of all the cursing occurrences.' The team say they wanted to find out it we cursed more on Twitter. 'Cursing is not uncommon during conversations in the physical world: 0.5% to 0.7% of all the words we speak are curse words, given that 1% of all the words are first-person plural pronouns (e.g., we, us, our),' the researchers wrote. Lack of imagination: The top seven curse words accounted for 90% of all curses, the researchers found . 'On social media, people can instantly chat with friends without face-to-face interaction, usually in a more public fashion and broadly disseminated through highly connected social network.' They also classified the cursing, and identified five different emotions from tweets - anger, joy, sadness, love, and thankfulness. 'Based on the classification results, we found that cursing on Twitter was . most closely associated with two negative emotions: sadness and anger. 'However, curse words could also be used to emphasize positive emotions such as joy or love.' Other insights in the paper involved timing, location, gender, and level of influence of the tweeters. People curse more and more as the day passes, reaching a peak at 12 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. before bedtime, and Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays contain the most curse words relative to tweet volume. Researcher say the hour before we go to sleep is when we are most likely to swear in a tweet . They also found user swore less when talking directly to another user. 'Our study of the relation between cursing and message types suggests that users perform self-censorship when they talk directly to other users. 'We find that users do curse more in relaxed environments, but the differences across different environments are very small, partly due to the fact that Twitter messages are posted in virtual digital world. They also found men tended to swear more. 'Men curse more than women, men overuse some curse words different from what women use and vice versa, and both men and women are more likely to curse in the same-gender contexts. Curses rises late at night just before people go to bed . A case of the Mondays? The study revealed we swear more in the early part of the week .\n","\n","\n","Summary Text : \n","Swearing peaks at 12 a.m. to 1:30 a.m.\n","top seven curses accounted for over 90% of offensive tweets .\n","one-month sample of 51 million English-language tweets analysed .\n","\n","\n","Fine tuned Predicted Summary Text : \n","['The top seven curse words accounted for over 90% of offensive tweets, according to the study.

Associated Press . Many of the exhausted dogs that have been in . search of victims of the deadly mudslide that buried a mountainside Washington . community will take a two-day break as the official death toll rose from 18 to 21. The dogs can lose their sensing ability if overworked in the cold and rain. ‘The . conditions on the slide field are difficult, so this is just a time to . take care of the dogs,’ said Kris Rietmann, a spokeswoman for the team . working on the eastern portion of the slide, which hit March 22 about 55 . miles northeast of Seattle and is one of the deadliest in U.S. history. Needed rest: Rescue dog Tryon, muddied from the day's work, stands with his handler near the west side of the mudslide on Highway 530 near mile marker 37  in Arlington, Washington. Dogs like Tryon have been given a two-day break from work because days of intense searching can dull their senses . Dogs from the Federal Emergency Management Agency that arrived more recently will continue working. Fifteen of the victims have been identified by the Snohomish County medical examiner, and six have yet to be identified, Biermann said. Another four bodies were found in the debris field on Sunday, but they won't be added to the official count until the medical examiner receives the bodies. Biermann said 30 people remain missing. Authorities have said the task of finding and identifying victims from the debris field has been extremely challenging, and not all may ultimately be recovered. Dirty job: Rescue dog Nexus, muddy from working onsite, waits to be decontaminated via hose. He's one of many that helped uncover four more bodies over the weekend . Slog: Periods of rain and wind have hampered efforts for days and constant exposure to the conditions can hurt dogs' ability to sense victims . Holding strong: Search and rescue teams navigate the wet, muddy terrain at the west side of the mudslide. While some dogs will be given a break, others will continue working in the unforgiving conditions over the next two days . Rescue dog Nexus, muddy from working onsite, strolls the staging area at the west side of the mudslide . FEMA dogs that were brought in more recently will continue to work as the local rescue dogs that have been searching for days will get a break . Crews have completed a makeshift road that will link one side of the debris field to the other, significantly aiding the recovery operation. They have also been working to clear mud and debris from the highway, leaving piles of gooey muck, splintered wood and housing insulation on the sides of the road. Searchers have had to contend with treacherous conditions, including septic tanks, gasoline and propane containers. When rescuers and dogs leave the site, they are hosed off by hazardous materials crews. The slide dammed up the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River, causing water to pool up on the east side. The river cut a new channel through the mud, but the rain has raised the water level nearly a foot, Rietmann said. In at least one place, the water level got so high that it covered areas that have already been searched, said Tim Pierce, leader of Washington Task Force 1, a search-and-rescue team. ‘At this point, there's no point in searching (that area) again until the water drops back down,’ he said. Rescuers should get some relief soon. Conditions were improving Sunday, and mainly dry weather is forecast Monday through Wednesday in western Washington. Devotion: The congregation of the Glad Tidings Assembly of God church in Darrington sings Sunday during morning church services . Staying strong: Much of the music and speaking at Sunday's service was devoted to reaction to the deadly mudslide that hit the nearby community of Oso . The size of the debris field is also smaller than initially thought, officials said Sunday. After review and analysis, geologists have determined it is about 300 acres — just under half the size of an earlier projection of 1 square mile. Away from the whirring chain saws and roaring bulldozers, many residents of nearby Darrington sought comfort in church services. ‘I can only compare it to a hot, hearty meal after a very cold day,’ said Slava Botamanenko, who works at the hospital in Arlington. He said he spent two nights there to be sure he was available for work after the mudslide blocked the road. All week, a steady stream of people has stopped in to pray at the Glad Tidings Assembly of God on the edge of town, said Lee Hagen, the senior pastor. ‘At a time like this, everybody knows they've got to have God's help,’ he said. Tough times: Search and rescue teams navigate the wet, muddy terrain at the west side of the mudslide. Soggy conditions have made the search effort difficult for both humans and dogs . Remembering what's important: An American flag pulled from the debris hangs in the staging area . Reaching out: Randy Fay, a volunteer rescue technician with Snohomish County's SnoHawk 10 rescue helicopter, helps Jetty Dooper, from the Netherlands . Terrible conditions: Search and rescue teams walk through a field of mud on a path of plywood at the west side of the mudslide . Evidence of tragedy: Assorted broken debris sits on a muddy suitcase pulled from the scene at the west side of the mudslide on Sunday . In it together: A sheriff chaplain offers a few words to a rescue worker as he enters the decontamination tent area . Firefighters navigate through downed trees as they carry shovels in the muck on Sunday . Country singer Susie McEntire, sister of Reba, performed for the congregation Sunday, crooning: ‘You'll get through this and you'll break new ground.’ At the St. John Mary Vianney Catholic church a few blocks away, Father Tim Sauer said: ‘Bless our communities, bless our people, bless our valley.’ The Rev. Owen Couch, a chaplain for the fire district in Darrington, said he's worried about the first responders. ‘My concern is when this slows down and they're not going full tilt, and they have time to kind of reflect on what they've seen and what they've done,’ he said. ‘That's when the critical incident stress starts to kick in.’ Steve Huot, lead chaplain for the Arlington Fire Department, said he is seeing people in various states. Some are in shock, while others have begun to grasp the reality of the disaster. Many are exhausted. ‘It's more about listening right now. You need to encourage them and maybe change their focus to staying busy for the group, for the team,’ he said.

A man has handed himself in almost 12 hours after allegedly running from the scene of a fatal car accident during a police chase northwest of Melbourne .

Police arrested a 27-year-old Sunbury woman at the scene and she is under police guard at Royal Melbourne Hospital. 'The fact they left their friends, one dead and one injured, and fled off into the bush probably speaks volumes about their character,' Assistant Commissioner Jack Blayney said of the two men who fled.

The four people took off in a sedan and police gave chase but a short time later, officers found the car had rolled on a nearby bend . A Sunbury man, 30, was later arrested on a roadside at nearby Gisborne about 9.45am on Saturday. He had minor injuries and remains in police custody. But police were still looking for the second man until Saturday evening when a 32-year-old from Diggers Rest showed up at Gisborne Police Station. He was being held for questioning. Investigators believe the car lost control in wet conditions and clipped a tree. 'If the police are indicating to people that they should pull over, they should pull over. It's not worth risking your life, the life of your friends, the life of innocent members of the public and also the lives of police officers for such trivial matters,' Blayney said.
