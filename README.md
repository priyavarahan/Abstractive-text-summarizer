# Abstractive-text-summarizer
Designed and implemented deep learning models including Pointer-Generator Networks, LSTM, BiLSTM, and BERT for abstractive text summarization. Utilized advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, enhancing model performance by integrating a pointer generator network, resulting in a 15% improvement in ROUGE and BLEU scores. Applied data preprocessing steps like tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand datasets and inform model development. Leveraged Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and NLTK for implementation, ensuring high-quality summaries by handling long-range dependencies, out-of-vocabulary words, and contextual embeddingsâ€‹
